# UserList-VIPER-SwiftUI

ðŸ“± UserListApp (VIPER + SwiftUI + SOLID Principles)

This is a sample iOS application showcasing how to build a scalable and testable iOS app using SwiftUI combined with the VIPER architecture pattern while following SOLID principles.

ðŸš€ Features

Fetches and displays user data from JSONPlaceholder.

Implements VIPER modules:

View (SwiftUI) â†’ Displays user list.
Interactor â†’ Handles data fetching logic.
Presenter â†’ Manages UI state, error handling, and loading state.
Entity â†’ Defines User model.
Router â†’ Handles module creation and navigation.

Uses Swift Concurrency (async/await) for networking.
Error handling with user-friendly messages.
Loading state with ProgressView.
Protocol-driven for easy testing and mockability.
